#  TripTask – Rider Service App (Web Demo)

**TripTask** is a simple and intuitive rider service app where users can **book rides**, track their trip status, and view ride history — all in one place. Built with **React Native** and **Expo**, it’s designed for cross-platform use on **iOS**, **Android**, and **Web**.

>  **Note:** This version is deployed on the **web only** for testing purposes. Due to publishing fees on mobile app stores, mobile deployment is currently paused.
